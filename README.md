# ReelRefreshers

## Description

If you've ever wanted to 
* Host a fun movie night with the pals 
* Have a romantic date with your special someone, or 
* Rock yourself to sleep to some good old-fashioned slasher noises...

With ReelRefreshers, you tell us what genre you feel like watching, and we'll give you a movie within that category, along with a random beverage.
